# beebify

A quick and very ugly script to get the BBC's radio charts and playlists as
 Spotify tracks.

There's not much more to it than that... I wanted to get the charts and
playlists from various BBC radio stations into Spotify: this is how I did it.

This was written using a previous version of the Spotify API, so it might 
need to be updated now that the Apps API has been released.

It's not very Pythonic, or readable, or modular, or reusable. But it's Good Enough (TM).

Via the magic of GitHub Pages <http://pages.github.com/>, there is an online
 version of the output at <http://adamobeng.github.com/beebify/>.
