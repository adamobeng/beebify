# beebify

A quick and very ugly script to get the BBC's radio charts and playlists as
 Spotify tracks.

There's not much more to it than that... I wanted to get the charts and
playlists from various BBC radio stations into Spotify: this is how I did it.

It's not very Pythonic, or readable, or modular, or reusable. But it's Good Enough (TM).
